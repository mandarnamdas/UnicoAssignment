Pre-requisites
  •	Wildfly 8.2.0
  •	Update the standalone.xml file to add below queue configuration under <jms-destinations> tag - 
	  <jms-queue name="messageQueue">
		  <entry name="java:/jms/queue/messageQueue"/>
	  </jms-queue>

Steps for execution - 
  •	Build the application using Maven.
  •	Deploy WAR under deployments folder of Wildfly application server.
  •	Once deployed hit application URL http://<hostName>:8080/RestfulWSDemo/
  •	Userwill be redirected to applications home page.
  •	Home page will display two links viz. "Push to Queue" and "Show Queue Data" to User.
  •	Click "Push to Queue" link to submit your data to queue.
  •	Click "Show Queue Data" link to view the data added in your queue.

Execute SOAP Web service
  •	Deploy the SOAP service on Wildfly application server.
  •	Hit wsdl URL http://<hostName>:8080/RestfulWSDemo/MySoapService?wsdl to check your SOAP service deployed correctly.
  •	Test all the methods from SOAP service using Soap UI.
  •	Click on "Show Queue Data" to check if messages are removed from queue after calculating GCD.

Assumptions – 
Assuming that the calculated GCD needs to be stored somewhere for further processing, I have used static list to 
store GCD values. [I tried using “hsqldb” to store GCD values but couldn’t integrate it successfully]
